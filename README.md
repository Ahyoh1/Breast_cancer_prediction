<h1> Breast cancer prediction </h1>
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer. It is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.

<h2> Aims and Objective </h2>

<p> The aim of this project is to determine if a patient has benign or malignant breast cancer given a number of breast measurements. </p>

<h2> Results and Accuracy </h2>

<p> The best performing models were the K-nearest neighbour and Random forest model  
<p> A <strong> ACCURACY SCORE</strong> of about 91% was achieved.</p>

<p> Further test can be carried out on same dataset 
to improve on the accuracy </p>
